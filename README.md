# ICA-8-Testing
In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and 
the next person peeing. For example, if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will 
choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle. That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the 
same time on public toilets with 5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first-person pees into urinal 2 or 4). 

In this assignement i created 2 files Urinals and UrinalsTest
In urinals i wrote the code to get the inputs 
If u write 10001 it returns 1
There is a file Urinal.dat In that u will see the inputs 
In the rule4 you will see the output
